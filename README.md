## CoffeeHouse Coupon Acceptance Analysis

My name is Nohelia Gil, I am based in San Francisco, California. This analysis has been conducted as part of an assignment for the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Certification program at UC Berkeley.

In this project, I analyze customer behavior related to CoffeeHouse coupon acceptance. Using a dataset collected from drivers through Amazon Mechanical Turk, the goal is to identify patterns and characteristics that influence whether a customer accepts or rejects a CoffeeHouse coupon. By exploring factors such as age, income, occupation, and driving habits, I aim to uncover insights that can help businesses better target customers with tailored coupon strategies.

This analysis demonstrates my ability to apply data science techniques, including data visualization, statistical summaries, and machine learning concepts, to derive meaningful insights from real-world data

## Data Overview
The dataset used in this analysis comes from Amazon Mechanical Turk and includes information about drivers' demographics, driving habits, and coupon usage.
## CoffeeHouse Analysis Summary

### Key Findings:
1. **Age**: Age does not significantly impact CoffeeHouse coupon acceptance. All age groups show similar acceptance rates.
2. **Income**: Lower-income drivers (under $50,000) are more likely to accept CoffeeHouse coupons, indicating that cost-saving incentives resonate more with these groups.
3. **Occupation**: Drivers in service-related jobs (e.g., food preparation) show higher acceptance rates for CoffeeHouse coupons, while those in outdoor jobs (e.g., farming) are less likely to accept.

### Hypotheses:
- **Hypothesis 1**: Drivers in lower-income groups are more likely to accept CoffeeHouse coupons.
- **Hypothesis 2**: Occupation affects coupon acceptance, with service-industry workers showing a higher acceptance rate.
- **Hypothesis 3**: Age does not significantly influence coupon acceptance.

## Further Analyses
This repository also includes analyses of other coupon categories, such as **bar coupons**. Below is a summary of findings:

### Bar Coupons:
1. **Frequency of Visits**: Drivers who go to bars more than once a month are more likely to accept bar coupons compared to those who rarely visit bars.
2. **Age and Bar Coupon Acceptance**: Drivers over the age of 25 who frequently visit bars tend to accept bar coupons at a higher rate than younger drivers.

## Conclusion
From the data, we conclude that **income** and **occupation** play crucial roles in determining coupon acceptance, particularly for CoffeeHouse coupons. Future work can explore other characteristics like family status or driving habits.
